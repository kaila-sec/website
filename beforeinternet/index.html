            <h2>Why Choose Kaila?</h2>
            <p>Kaila is a decentralized peer-to-peer communication platform that ensures data sovereignty remains with the users. It runs locally on the user's device, relying on minimal infrastructure, and can be used in any modern browser.</p>

        <section id="principles">
            <h2>Our Principles</h2>
            <p>At Kaila, we strongly believe that your data belongs to you. Therefore, we remain true to the following principles in the development of Kaila:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>End-to-End Encryption: Information is end-to-end encrypted with backward and forward secrecy.</li>
                <li>Data Sovereignty: The data resides with the user and should not be stored centrally.</li>
                <li>Security by Design: Security and data sovereignty was the top priority in the design and development from the very beginning.</li>
                <!-- Add more principles here -->
            </ul>

        <section id="technical-details">
            <h2>Technical Details</h2>
            <p>Kaila is a decentralized platform based on modern web technologies and security standards. For the establishment of the peer-to-peer connection and the asynchronous message transmission, a signaling between users is mandatory. Once a direct connection between the users is established, video, audio and data streams can be transmitted directly without a server in between.</p>

        <section id="use-cases">
            <h2>Use Cases</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Communication between independent parties: Each party has its own communication system. We show you how to build a comprehensive, independent system with Kaila in which no party can claim complete data sovereignty for itself.</li>
                <li>Concert / Festival / Sport Event: The aim of this use case is to put a temporary communication medium (during the duration of the event) quickly and easily into operation. The users have a simple entry and exit, without their data being stored in the long term.</li>
                <li>Enterprise Collaboration: You want a communication system, but you don't want to be dependent on any cloud provider or a proprietary system? If you use Kaila, all these points are fulfilled. In addition, you can comfortably use all modern communication features securely.</li>
            </ul>
